# Bankist

Bankist is a sample internet banking website I created while learning Javascript


## Usage

You can test out the functionalites of the website using the following username and pin:

js : 1111

jd : 2222

Transfering uses the username of the receiver's account


## Credits

I only wrote the Javascript file(s) for this project. Credits to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)
